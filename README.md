# Breast Cancer Prediction Project
This project uses classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Machine) to predict a malignant or benign tumor based on features used from this Kaggle dataset.

The methods included were building a classification model to predict binary outcomes and using probability estimates.

The Kaggle dataset used can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/breast-cancer-dataset).
